        <h3>SECTION 7: Health Care Power of Attorney</h3>
        <h4>
            A health care power of attorney gives a person of your choosing, your "attorney-in-fact," the power to manage your
            health care. Typically, a health care directive is used in estate planning in part to ensure your health care
            directive and your wishes concerning medical treatment are carried out. Your attorney-in-fact for health care
            decisions has the power to admit or discharge you into a health care facility, consent to treatment, pay health
            care expenses, and authorize disclosure of your medical records. Like a general power of attorney, it is important
            to choose someone you trust that will carry out your wishes.
