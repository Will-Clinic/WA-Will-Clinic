            <h2>Beneficiary Information - Specific Bequests</h2>
            <h4>
                Specific bequest may be made with through a list attached to you will. This is one way that tangible personal
                property or specific amount of money be given to the named individual(s). Specific bequests are distributed from
                your assets first, and may make up the bulk of your estate or deplete it entirely. Specific bequests may also lapse
                if the specific property cannot be found at your death (i.e., the gift will become void). Thus, it is important to make
                specific bequests of property that you are reasonably sure you will have when you die.

                YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE SPECIFIC BEQUESTS. If you make no specific bequests, all of your assets
                will pass to the remainder (or residuary) beneficiaries of your estate. WA Vets Will Clinic only handles specific
                bequests of tangible personal property or other items pursuant to a written list (i.e., those permitted in RCW
                11.12.260).

                The WA Vets Will Clinic DOES NOT handle specific bequests of REAL PROPERTY.

                exercise certain decision making functions on behalf of, and in the place of, a minor child (under age 18). If you
                have minor children when you die, and if the other natural/adoptive parent of the child not alive or for any reason
                cannot act as guardian, a court may appoint a guardian of your choosing to have custody and decision making
                authority for your child/children until they reach age 18. If you have sole custody, upon your death, the child’s other
                natural or adopted parent will be entitled to act as parent even if you provide for someone else to serve as
                guardian in your Will. However, it is still advisable to name a guardian in case the other parent is unable or
                unwilling to serve as guardian.
